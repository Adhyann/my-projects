Hospital Management System (C Program)

This project is a simple **Hospital Management System** written in **C language**.
It allows the user to manage patient records including adding, updating, searching, deleting, and tracking patient details such as disease, doctor, room number, and admission status.

This is a **console-based** project, suitable for beginners learning **C programming, structures, functions, and data handling**.

 **Features of the Project**

**Add New Patient**

Add a patient with details like ID, name, age, gender, disease, doctor, and room number.

**Display All Patients**

View a list of all stored patient records.

**Search Patient by ID**

Find a specific patient using their unique ID.

**Update Patient Details**

Modify existing patient details such as disease, doctor, age, etc.

**Delete Patient Record**

Remove a patient completely from the system.

**Show Statistics**

Displays:

* Total number of patients
* Average age
* Count of male, female & other gender patients

**List Only Admitted Patients**

Shows patients who are currently admitted (room number ≠ 0).

**Discharge Patient**

Changes admission status to discharged and resets room number to 0.

**Technologies Used**

* **C Programming Language**
* **Structures**
* **Arrays**
* **Functions**
* **Console Input/Output**

**How the Code Works**

### **1. Patient Structure**

A `struct Patient` stores:

* ID
* Name
* Age
* Gender
* Disease
* Assigned doctor
* Room number
* Admission status

### **2. Patient Database**

* Uses an array:
  `struct Patient patients[100];`
* Supports up to **100 patient records**

 **3. Menu-Driven Program**

The program runs a loop showing a menu:

```
1. Add Patient
2. Display All Patients
3. Search Patient
4. Update Patient
5. Delete Patient
6. Statistics
7. List Admitted Patients
8. Discharge Patient
0. Exit
```



If you want, I can also create:

✅ A **PDF project report**
✅ A **Word file**
✅ A **flowchart** for your program
✅ A **UML diagram**

Just tell me!
